```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)

# load mtcars dataset
data("mtcars")

# set knitr chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a sandbox to play around with the `reticulate` R package in order to learn Python and its interactions with R.

# Installing packages with Conda

Packages can be installed with Conda using the `reticulate::conda_install()` command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
reticulate::conda_install(packages = "pandas")
```

# Running Python code

Python code can be run within a `python` code chunk. Objects created within the R environment can be accessed in a Python code chunk using `r.`.

```{python}
import pandas

print(r.mtcars.head())
```
